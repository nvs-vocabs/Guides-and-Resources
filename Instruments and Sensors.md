# Instruments and sensors

Instruments and sensors are described in the SeaVox Device Catalogue collection L22: https://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/search_nvs/L22/. Requests for new terms can be made by creating a new issue at https://github.com/nvs-vocabs/L22/issues.

The majority of terms represent individual sampling or measuring devices, however some do not fit the mould exactly. We suffix some terms with either 'system' or 'series', to account for these complexities, with definitions for each as below. Users requesting new terms may wish to include the suffix in their request, but this is not mandatory, we are happy to make the decision when we create the term, and will discuss with you or manufacturers to gather additional information where necessary to inform this decision. 
 
## System definition:
An instrument system represents an integrated assembly of interrelated components that function collectively to perform complex tasks like navigation, analytical chemistry, or meteorology. Example: [TOOL2128](http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/L22/current/TOOL2128/).

## Series definition:
An instrument series refers to a group of closely related instruments that share a common product design and core function, but may exhibit minor variations in components or configurations. These variations can include differences in power cabling, mounting, housing material, cell chambers, measurement options, and communication interfaces. Differences may lead to changes in performance or capabilities in some cases, however instruments within a series tend to be functionally similar and are therefore categorised together. Typically a series of instruments belongs to the same manufacturer and model range. Example: [TOOL2141](http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/L22/current/TOOL2141/). 

A 'series' term can be used if unsure of the exact model within the range.
